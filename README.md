# Albumlist Slack App

This is a [Slack](https://slack.com/) app that scrapes and compiles lists of ([bandcamp](https://www.bandcamp.com)) albums that have been shared by a Slack team.

## Deploy to Heroku

You can deploy this app yourself to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) to play with - though I would suggest forking this repository first and tweaking the environment variables listed under "env" in the [app.json file](https://github.com/Ogreman/albumlist/blob/master/app.json).
